# SparLiang

This is a semi-private website for me and my family. We can make blog posts and share videos/pictures with family and friends. That's enough for now; I hope to extend it in the future as the need arises.

## NextJS + ChakraUI + TinaUI
These are the main NodeJS packages used here. NextJS is fast and easy to host. ChakraUI looks good and lets me do CSS-in-JS to keep everything in one place. TinaUI lets other people make posts as well.

## Hosted on Netlify
Netlify is free and does a lot for you.
